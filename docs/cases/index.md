 - Key plates are strongly recommended, but not technically required. If you use 3 pin MX keys, the thumb keys tend to fall out if you don't use a key plate.
 - The key plates combined with a backplate make a nice 'sandwich' case. You can cover up the sandwich case with the 'monobody' cover.
 - @todo - rewrite all of this to adapt from Sofle
 - Spacers are intended to pass through the main pcb and screw onto the bottom plates, top plates, and OLED plates.
 - Plates can be made from acrylic, pcb, or 3d printed. @todo - design pcb based plates.
 - Having a standoff kit is helpful when assembling the keyplates. [M2 Brass Standoff Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B9X1KY6)
 - Acrylic key plates for MX switches should be 3mm thick, and 2mm for choc switches. @todo - validate the choc depth.
 - PCB cases should be 1.6mm thick. The switches fit better in the PCBs because most switches have 'retention nubs' designed for PCBs.<br><img src="/images/build_guide_pico/sofle_pico_retention_nubs.png" alt="switch retention nubs" width="20%">

Acrylic plates are assembled using standoffs that run through the board. Standoff lengths for the PCB plates will be different than the acrylic plates. FDM plates screw directly to the board, and do not use standoffs.

@todo - case assembly animation?
