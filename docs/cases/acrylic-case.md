## Details

These don't retain the switches as tightly as the 3d printed cases, but they look fantastic. 

Rather than purchase multiple size female-female 2mm standoffs, using an '[assortment box](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B9X1KY6)' is much easier.

The production ready files for upload can be found in the "production_ready" folder. They are zipped .dxf files. I recommend 3mm thickness. Some online vendors ask you to manually input the dimensions for pricing. Dimensions can be found in the BOM remarks below.

| M2 6mm female-female standoffs | 16 | Connects the front plate to the back plate, runs _through_ the pcb.

## About these plates
This case was created by exporting svg layers directly from KiCad. The Svg's were imported into Fusion360 with a 3.7795% scale. (Not sure why the KiCad exports are so small - but that multiplier seems to get them where they need to go). From Fusion360, the outlines are exported as a .dxf. The .dxf's have been zipped because the only vendor I've tested these with is Elecrow. If you need another file type, you can find the initial svg's in the 'source' folder.
