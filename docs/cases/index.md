 - Key plates are strongly recommended, but not technically required. If you use 3 pin MX keys, the thumb keys tend to fall out if you don't use a key plate.
 - The key plates combined with a backplate make a nice 'sandwich' case. You can cover up the sandwich case with the 'monobody' cover.
 - @todo - rewrite all of this to adapt from Sofle
 - Spacers are intended to pass through the main pcb and screw onto the bottom plates, top plates, and OLED plates.
 - Plates can be made from acrylic, or 3d printed. 
 - Having a standoff kit is helpful when assembling the keyplates. [M2 Brass Standoff Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B9X1KY6)
 - Acrylic key plates should only be used for MX switches. (The choc switches retention nubs only allow 1.5mm or 1.6mm plates, which aren't recommended with acrylic).
 - PCB cases should be 1.6mm thick. The switches fit better in the PCBs because most switches have 'retention nubs' designed for PCBs.<br><img src="/images/build_guide_pico/sofle_pico_retention_nubs.png" alt="switch retention nubs" width="20%">

Acrylic plates are assembled using standoffs that run through the board. 3d printed FDM plates screw directly to the board, and do not use standoffs.

@todo - case assembly animation?
