 - @todo - This has been rewritten to adapt from Sofle, but needs images updated.

 - Key plates are strongly recommended, but not technically required. If you use 3 pin MX keys, the thumb keys tend to fall out if you don't use a key plate.
 - Plates can be made from acrylic, or 3d printed.
 - The 3d printed or acrylic key plates combined with a backplate make a nice 'sandwich' case. 
 - You can cover up the sandwich case with the 3d printed 'monobody' cover.
 - Spacers are intended to pass through the main pcb and screw onto the bottom plates, top plates, and MCU & Solenoid plates. 
 - Having a standoff kit is helpful when assembling the keyplates. [M2 Brass Standoff Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B9X1KY6)
 - Acrylic key plates should only be used for MX switches. (The choc switches retention nubs only allow 1.5mm or 1.6mm plates, which aren't recommended with acrylic).
